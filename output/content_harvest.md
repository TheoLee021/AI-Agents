### Please provide the topic to continue.

Notes for you (optional, after you provide the topic):
- I will search for recent news on the topic and identify credible sources.
- I will exclude topic hubs, tag listings, and any pages that lack a clear article headline and publication date.
- I will scrape each accepted article to extract title, source, publication date, and full text.
- I will filter out articles shorter than 200 words, older than 48 hours (unless specially relevant), or those that fail to scrape.
- I will classify each article into a category (e.g., Tech, Politics, Business, Science, Health, International, etc.).
- I will assign credibility scores (1-10) based on source reputation and content quality.
- I will assign relevance scores (1-10) based on how closely the article matches the topic.
- I will present the results in the exact format you specified:
  - A well-structured Markdown document with a header for the topic
  - A collection summary
  - A list of accepted articles, each with: Article Headline, Source, Date, URL, Category, Credibility Score, Relevance Score
  - Clearly separated by "---" between articles

When you provide the topic, Iâ€™ll deliver a full, ready-to-use report in the required format.
