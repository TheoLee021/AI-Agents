**Stories Covered:** 1 Lead Story, 3 Breaking Developments, 1 Media & Misinformation, 1 Health & Humanitarian  

## Executive Summary  
A tentative ceasefire brokered by Malaysia has opened a slim window for diplomacy along the contested 800-km Cambodia–Thailand frontier. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha hailed the five-day truce as “the cusp of a new era,” while both governments prepare to sign a landmark demining pact and explore joint security committees. Yet sporadic firefights this week underscored the ceasefire’s fragility, prompting an emergency ASEAN video conference. On the ground, demining teams are racing to clear unexploded ordnance near the Preah Vihear temple and safety corridors are allowing displaced villagers to return, even as aid workers warn of looming health crises and social-media networks battle torrents of fake war footage. Today’s briefing unpacks these intersecting developments—diplomatic, military, humanitarian and informational—to show why Southeast Asia’s flashpoint remains perilously balanced between dialogue and renewed violence.

## 🚨 Today's Lead Story  
### Thai PM: “We’re on the cusp of a new era” as truce holds—mostly  
Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha declared cautious optimism after both sides observed a five-day Malaysia-brokered ceasefire “for the most part.” Addressing defence ministers in Bangkok, Prayuth detailed the launch of joint demining teams clearing unexploded ordnance along the 800-km border, and said talks are underway to formalize confidence-building measures—ranging from joint patrols to an incident-reporting hotline. He credited ASEAN unity and Malaysia’s mediation for the breakthrough, but warned that “peace is fragile” without robust monitoring. Analysts note that sustaining this truce will require transparent observer missions and tangible gains for civilian communities.

## 📈 Breaking News & Developments  
Diplomatic and military developments continue to reshape the conflict’s dynamics—both raising hopes for de-escalation and revealing the ceasefire’s vulnerability.  

### Thailand and Cambodia to sign demining agreement  
After weeks of deadly skirmishes, Bangkok and Phnom Penh will formalize a Malaysian-brokered demining pact today. The agreement sets up joint clearance teams, shared minefield maps and funding for local veterans, with Cambodia providing engineers and Thailand supplying detection equipment. Humanitarian groups warn that monsoon floods may shift buried mines, heightening urgency for rapid, internationally supervised operations.

### Fresh clashes erupt despite ceasefire  
Sporadic gunfire and mortar exchanges flared in at least three villages—including Anlong Veng—injuring dozens of civilians and border guards. Thai authorities blamed “rogue elements,” while Cambodian officials pointed to Thai militias. ASEAN foreign ministers held an emergency video link session to discuss tighter monitoring—potentially deploying unarmed observers or satellite surveillance—to prevent the truce from collapsing.

### Thailand opens dialogue on joint security committee  
Thai and Cambodian envoys reconvened in Kuala Lumpur to extend the five-day ceasefire and negotiate a standing border security committee and incident-reporting protocols. The talks follow July clashes that killed 38 people and displaced over 300,000. Both sides signaled willingness to host ASEAN monitors, and Thailand offered to host subsequent negotiations in Bangkok next week.

## 💻 Media & Information  
Across digital platforms, a parallel battle for truth is unfolding—one that could make or break public support for peace efforts.  

### Misinformation floods online on Thailand–Cambodia conflict  
Doctored videos and images alleging atrocities on both sides have spread widely, ABC News Australia reports. Meta and TikTok removed over 250 posts in the past week, including a 2023 Myanmar clip misattributed to Cambodian forces and a Thai movie still circulated as real combat footage. Experts warn these false narratives stoke nationalism and impede reconciliation. In response, the ASEAN Secretariat is funding a rapid-response fact-check network to verify content within 24 hours and counter hate speech.

## 💼 Health & Humanitarian  
As fighting ebbs and flows, civilians and aid workers bear the deepest scars of conflict.  

### Health workers scramble amid trauma surge, halted vaccinations  
Frontline clinics on both sides have treated over 200 trauma cases since July 24, Médecins Sans Frontières says. Cambodia’s Oddar Meanchey hospital is operating at 150% capacity, reusing wound kits and rationing antibiotics, while Thai military field hospitals face security-imposed curfews. Suspension of cholera and measles vaccination campaigns has prompted WHO warnings of secondary outbreaks if the ceasefire falters. Humanitarian groups are calling for protected medical-access zones and emergency supply corridors.

## 🎯 Editor’s Analysis  
**Key Themes Today:**  
- **Fragile Ceasefire:** Diplomatic gains abound, but local violations underscore the need for robust monitoring.  
- **Confidence-Building in Action:** Demining and joint-security talks offer concrete steps toward trust, yet require sustained funding and oversight.  
- **Information Front:** Digital misinformation is an emerging front line—threatening to undercut peace if left unchecked.  

**What This Means:**  
The Cambodia–Thailand border crisis is evolving from kinetic skirmishes into a multi-dimensional contest of diplomacy, demining, humanitarian relief and information control. Success hinges on ASEAN’s ability to enforce agreements on the ground, marshal international support for clearance and medical operations, and inoculate public discourse against incendiary falsehoods.  

**Looking Ahead:**  
- ASEAN to finalize observer deployment framework and rapid-response fact-check network.  
- First joint demining teams to begin operations near Preah Vihear temple—watch for safety-corridor progress.  
- Next round of talks in Bangkok to define a standing border security committee and incident-reporting protocols.
