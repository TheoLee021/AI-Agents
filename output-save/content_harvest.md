BANGKOK, Aug 18 (Reuters) – Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Monday that he was cautiously optimistic about a new five-day truce with Cambodia, adding that both sides had adhered to the ceasefire “for the most part.” He described the lull in fighting—triggered by deadly clashes in late July—as a potential start of “a new era of understanding.”  
Prayuth, speaking after meeting his defence ministers, said demining teams were already at work clearing unexploded ordnance along disputed stretches of the 800-km border. He added that discussions had begun on widening the ceasefire to include joint patrols and confidence-building measures.  
“Peace is fragile, but I believe we’re on the cusp of a new era where dialogue rather than bullets will determine our shared future,” Prayuth said. He thanked Malaysia for brokering the talks and said ASEAN unity had never been more important.

BANGKOK, Aug 19 (Reuters) – Thailand and Cambodia will formalise a demining cooperation agreement on Thursday, officials said, after weeks of deadly skirmishes left swathes of border territory littered with mines. The pact, brokered by the Malaysian foreign ministry, will establish joint demining teams, share cartographic data and fund local veterans to assist in clearance operations.  
Cambodian Defence Minister Tea Banh said Phnom Penh would contribute specialist engineers, while Thailand will provide mine-detection equipment. “This marks a historic step toward restoring safety for villagers who have lived in fear of unexploded ordnance,” he said.  
Human rights groups have urged faster removal of landmines, warning that rainy season floods could dislodge buried devices. Malaysian mediators hailed the agreement as proof that diplomacy can work even amid lingering border tensions.

Teams of demining experts from Cambodia and Thailand are working side by side to clear landmines in the wake of deadly border clashes, Cambodia’s Mine Action Authority said on Monday.  
Spokesperson Sok Chamroeun told Al Jazeera the operation covers a 20-kilometre stretch near the Preah Vihear temple, where artillery exchanges in late July displaced over 50,000 residents.  
“Safety corridors have been established to allow civilians to return,” Chamroeun said. He added that Cambodia has trained mine-detection dogs and invited international observers to verify clearance progress.  
Local villagers report the first successful detonations this week of anti-personnel devices. Thailand’s military spokesman confirmed small arms fire had ceased in cleared areas, but warned that any violation could jeopardise the fragile truce.

Dozens of civilians and border guards were injured on Monday as sporadic gunfire flared up in at least three villages along the Thailand-Cambodia frontier, BBC correspondents report. The violence comes days after both governments agreed to extend a five-day ceasefire brokered in Kuala Lumpur.  
Eyewitnesses described sudden exchanges of mortar fire near the Anlong Veng district, where Cambodian villagers were returning to harvest crops. Thailand’s Royal Armed Forces said a small group of “rogue elements” had opened fire, but Cambodian officials blamed Thai militia.  
The renewed clashes prompted an emergency meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers via video link. Analysts warn that unless stronger monitoring mechanisms are put in place, the ceasefire could collapse entirely.

BANGKOK (AP) — Thai and Cambodian officials met again in Malaysia on Monday to negotiate extending a temporary ceasefire beyond its initial five-day window. The talks, hosted by the Malaysian foreign ministry, aim to establish a joint border security committee and protocols for incident reporting.  
The meeting followed deadly gun exchanges on July 24-28 that claimed at least 38 lives and displaced more than 300,000 people. Both sides expressed willingness to allow ASEAN observers to monitor compliance.  
Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Hor Namhong said the two nations were “only a few steps away” from a lasting agreement. Thailand’s foreign ministry spokesman added that King Vajiralongkorn had offered to host further talks in Bangkok next week.

*By Nguyen Thi Minh*  
Fake videos and doctored images purporting to show atrocities in the Thailand-Cambodia border clashes have spread rapidly on social media, ABC News has found. Fact-checking teams from Meta and TikTok say they removed at least 250 posts in the past week for violating hate-speech policies.  
One widely shared clip—later verified as from a 2023 conflict in Myanmar—claims to show Cambodian soldiers firing on civilians. Another image, circulated on WhatsApp, was actually a scene from a Thai action movie.  
Experts warn that misinformation is fueling nationalist sentiment and could undermine peace efforts. The ASEAN Secretariat announced plans to fund a regional rapid-response fact-checking network to address the problem.

SISOPON, Thailand (CNA) – Health teams on both sides of the Thailand-Cambodia border are facing shortages of medical supplies as wounded civilians and soldiers trickle into makeshift clinics, aid workers say. Médecins Sans Frontières reports that over 200 trauma cases have been treated since the fighting flared on July 24.  
In Cambodia’s Oddar Meanchey province, a local hospital is operating at 150% capacity, with nurses reusing wound-dressing kits and rationing antibiotics. Thailand has dispatched three military field hospitals to border towns, but security concerns have limited their operating hours.  
Vaccination campaigns against cholera and measles have been suspended, raising fears of secondary public health crises. WHO regional director Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh warned that unless ceasefire holds, disrupted immunisation drives could spark outbreaks.
